# DH 110 Assignment 5
#### Ashley Lee

## Overview

### Purpose 

For this project, I chose to redesign the Facebook Marketplace page. This platform allows people and businesses to buy and sell items within their community and neighborhood and is used widely by users on Facebook. I want to redesign the buying and selling functions on the page, since these are the main activities that users engage with. 

By making a low-fidelity prototype for my project, I am able to test out my ideas with my target users before diving into the high-fidelity prototype. This provides me with a quick way to test the contents of my design without investing too much time and energy into a high-fidelity design and possibly realizing that several issues need to be addressed and fixed. 

### User Research
Based on my contextual inquiry, I will focus on these two research questions:
* How might we allow sellers to easily list their items in an accurate way?
* How might we allow buyers to trust their sellers when browsing for items on this platform? 

Here is more information on the [user research](https://github.com/ashleyalee/DH110/tree/main/assignment3).

### Personas and Scenarios
I created two personas and scenarios centered around features that would solve each research question.
* A rising undergraduate college student who needs to furnish her apartment but does not want to invest in furniture since she is only living at this apartment temporarily and also wants to live a more sustainable lifestyle. She also plans on selling these items once she moves out to get rid of them but also as a source of income as a side hustle. However, she is skeptical of the sellers on the platform and always needs to verify before making any purchases. 
* An overwhelmed stay-at-home mom who needs to shop for her family. She understands that her children grow out of clothes quickly, so she wants to purchase second-hand. She always compares prices with first-hand items to ensure her purchase is worthwhile. As a consequence, she also wants to sell their clothes online since they're only worn for such a short period of time.

### Tasks/Features
1. List a product and reference its existing product page from a third party vendor's site (so buyers can see full product description and original price).
2. Seller verification system that allows buyers to message sellers and also write/read reviews about buyers only after purchasing from them.

### Reflection
I enjoyed drawing the wireframes and designing how I'd like it to look like. When I want to add some buttoms or features, I searched online to see how they look like that way I can replicate it. Putting my ideas onto paper is harder than I thought but it is a fun process nonetheless. When I draw the wireflows, I can see what I need to add to the wireframes. From testing the prototype, I found even more missed elements in the wireframes, such as a **Next** button rather than just a **Skip** button.  

The next time I create wireframes and wireflows, I would make a flow chart with just words so I can visualize the entire sequence in order to include all the buttons. For this prototype, I would need to add all the buttons and draw the wireframes for all the other buttons I included but were not going to be tested. If I need to be more detailed, I would draw dropdown menus to wireframes that have them too. 

By only creating one type of sequence (e.g. one sequence to make a report on an abandoned car), I guide the participant into pressing the only button they can choose so I can realize the importance of drawing all the wireframes of the app that way they can have a near complete experience. I would also have the participant draw the flow and mark the mistakes/confusion on the actual wireframe itself instead of doing it for them.
