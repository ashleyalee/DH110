## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
The purpose of UX Storytelling is to place your shoes in the user's and better understand where they are coming from. By taking a deep dive into your target user, you can gain insight about their behaviors, habits, story, and frustrations. Storytelling allows you to use this information to design a product focused on the user, rather than your own ideologies or biases that you may initially have. This ensures that you are not designing a product solely based on your own ideas and are working toward creating one that is user-centered. 

## Tasks to Propose for the UX Design
1. **Price Comparison Between New and Used Items**
   - This feature will allow users to compare the used item with the new item when shopping. Users will be able to easily see how a specific product compares when it is used vs. when it is new. This can help buyers to decide if this item is worth purchasing used or new, since oftentimes, shoppers are stuck between deciding to purchase a new or used item because of price or other factors.
3. **Product ID Feature**
   - When listing a product on the marketplace, this feature will pull up the product's original selling page after the user inputs keywords and searches for the item. This will allow buyers to have more details about the product itself and can also help the seller to have a baseline when pricing the item.

## Scenarios & Journey Map

### 1. Sadie's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Sadie is using this product
> Sadie currently sells and buys used items online because it is much convenient for her to do so there than in person. As Sadie is moving in to her new apartment in Seattle for the summer, she is looking to furnish her place to make it feel like home. However, knowing that she is only living here for a summer, she looks for items that are used so they can ideally save money and not have to invest in something she can not bring home with her. In the same way, she decides that she can sell these items after moving home and needs a platform to do so. Sadie decides to browse for and sell used products in a central place online (in the application). 

#### How Sadie is using this product
> Sadie browses through the application several times a day to see what is available at the moment. She searches for furniture, such as a coffee table. While browsing, she wants to compare prices with new pieces to ensure that she is getting the best deal, even if she is only temporarily owning this coffee table. She thinks that if she is to buy this product brand new for a comparable price, she may be able to make more money off of it when trying to sell it later. She uses the price comparison feature that allows her to do this easily, without her needing to google or search for it herself. With the click of a button, she can see other listings of this product from retailers.

### 2. Linda's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Linda is using this product
> Nicole just moved to Irvine from New York after getting married. She really misses her four best friends from back in New York. They used to have a book club where every month, they read one book and meet at her apartment to talk about it over dinner. Nicole and her friends still want to have an “online book club,” where they can discuss books and recommend new books to each other. She also wants to be able to track and organize all of the books she’s read by herself and with her friends.

#### How Linda is using this product
> After dinner, Nicole opens the app to see that her friend Lisa posted a comment about a book she and her friends are reading together. She responds to the comment by clicking the “reply” button under Lisa’s comment. Nicole also found a new book she wants to read with them, so she types in the title of the book in the search bar, then clicks “share,” and shares them to her friends.

## Reflection
* Coming up with personas was more difficult than I expected. Thinking of unbiased, diverse personas while taking everything from the heuristic evaluations and user interviews into account made me really feel like I knew these users personally. 
* Next time, I would also like to take research about more demographic information, such as the main population group that
reads books or uses reading apps, to make decisions about personas.
