## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
The purpose of UX Storytelling is to place your shoes in the user's and better understand where they are coming from. By taking a deep dive into your target user, you can gain insight about their behaviors, habits, story, and frustrations. Storytelling allows you to use this information to design a product focused on the user, rather than your own ideologies or biases that you may initially have. This ensures that you are not designing a product solely based on your own ideas and are working toward creating one that is user-centered. 

## Tasks to Propose for the UX Design
1. **Price Comparison Between New and Used Items**
   - This feature will allow users to compare the used item with the new item when shopping. Users will be able to easily see how a specific product compares when it is used vs. when it is new. This can help buyers to decide if this item is worth purchasing used or new, since oftentimes, shoppers are stuck between deciding to purchase a new or used item because of price or other factors.
3. **Product ID Feature**
   - When listing a product on the marketplace, this feature will pull up the product's original selling page after the user inputs keywords and searches for the item. This will allow buyers to have more details about the product itself and can also help the seller to have a baseline when pricing the item.

## üó∫ Scenarios & Journey Map

### 1. Mai's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Mai is using this product
> Mai currently volunteers at the Children‚Äôs Hospital Los Angeles while she takes a gap year before applying to medical school. She wants to become a pediatrician, so being able to connect to children and their parents is something she really values. Recently, a 12-year old patient she helps take care of asked Mai what books she recommends. Thus, Mai decided to explore children and young adult books she can recommend to patients. She wants to log books in a creative, journal-like way with colors and maybe even drawings, so her patients would also feel encouraged to log books and share them. However, she wants to be able to digitize her logs so more people can have access to them.

#### How Mai is using this product
> During her lunch break, Mai turns her phone on to log a book: Charlotte‚Äôs Web. When she opens the application, there is a button to ‚Äúlog book‚Äù in the menu, so she presses that. A new window pops up and she fills in the empty spaces that say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the title?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the author?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the genre?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat did you think of this book?‚Äù... and so on. After typing those sections, Mai looks at the book log journal-entry, and decides to add some color. She clicks the edit button, and clicks the option to highlight certain sections and change the color and font of the words. Feeling satisfied, she presses the ‚Äúpublish‚Äù button, where she can share it through various social media and even print it as a pdf.

### 2. Nicole's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Nicole is using this product
> Nicole just moved to Irvine from New York after getting married. She really misses her four best friends from back in New York. They used to have a book club where every month, they read one book and meet at her apartment to talk about it over dinner. Nicole and her friends still want to have an ‚Äúonline book club,‚Äù where they can discuss books and recommend new books to each other. She also wants to be able to track and organize all of the books she‚Äôs read by herself and with her friends.

#### How Nicole is using this product
> After dinner, Nicole opens the app to see that her friend Lisa posted a comment about a book she and her friends are reading together. She responds to the comment by clicking the ‚Äúreply‚Äù button under Lisa‚Äôs comment. Nicole also found a new book she wants to read with them, so she types in the title of the book in the search bar, then clicks ‚Äúshare,‚Äù and shares them to her friends.

## Reflection
* Coming up with personas was more difficult than I expected. Thinking of unbiased, diverse personas while taking everything from the heuristic evaluations and user interviews into account made me really feel like I knew these users personally. 
* Next time, I would also like to take research about more demographic information, such as the main population group that
reads books or uses reading apps, to make decisions about personas.
