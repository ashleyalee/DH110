## Pilot Usability Test

### Introduction

The Less is More website is the ultimate waste reduction resource for citizens of Santa Barbara county. The page breaks down the different types of waste and how one should reduce, reuse, or recycle each type of waste. The user is able to learn about all types of waste and the proper way to dispose of each type.

After conducting a heuristic analysis on this website, several usability problems were apparent. 

- First, the website did a poor job implementing recognition rather than recall. While the site does have labels for most pages, the pages themselves do not have enough labels that allow users to recognize information in the interface with ease.
- Second, the website does not have a aesthetic and minimalistic design, given all the different labels and information on each page.
- Third, the website has poor visibility of system status. It is not completely clear what page the user is on after navigating to a new page.
- Fourth, the website struggles with flexibility and efficiency of use. The information on the page is arranged in ways that require the reader to take a certain path in order to reach the information they are looking for. 
- Fifth, the website lacks consistency and standards. Some pages are designed inconsistent to others, which make it difficult for the reader to find something once they have navigated to a new page.

Given these usability issues, I will conduct a usability test to evaluate the extent of how the website enhances or hinders the user's ability to conduct specific tasks. A usability test is utilized to examine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the Less is More web page. In Task 1, I will ask the user to find out how they are to dispose of non-rechargeable batteries. In Task 2, the user is asked to find out how one would properly dispose of a Christmas tree. Because the path to get to this page is different than you are to arrive at information about non-rechargeable batteries, I can observe how the lack of consistency and standards in the website affect the time it takes for a user to complete this task. In Task 3, the user is asked to research what happens to their waste. Through the survey, I will be able to identify the flexbility and efficiency of use of the website, since they will need to find specific information that is not explicitly highlighted/labeled for them on the page. The goal is to understand and improve the website's usability from the user's perspective.

## Methodology

For the usability test,  I will conduct it within a quiet room of my apartment at UCLA. I will be using my own Macbook Air laptop as the recording device, and I will be using Zoom to record the session. 

The user and I will sit adjacent to each other throughout this process. I will ask for the user's informed consent before beginning and proceeding through the survey. The user will provide detailed feedback about their thought process and evaluate the extent to which task completion was successful. The user will also assess other elements such as how quickly tasks are completed, the degree of satisfaction and comfort the user feels toward the website, and potential suggestions for improvement. Finally, the user will complete a section on demographic data which will be kept confidential. 

This usability test is intended as a pilot test.

## Reflection

When conducting the usability test, I would frequently have to remind myself not to help the user through the task as a more experienced user of the website and as someone who designed the test. I was surprised by the difficulty the user experienced when going through the first task. Although I expected there to be a challenge trying to find the section about non-rechargeable batteries since the page only had labels about rechargeable batteries, I thought the user would be led to think that non-rechargeable battery information was on the same page. This unexpected outcome almost caused me to intervene on the test to prevent the user from leaving the page. For future user testing sessions, I would ensure that I would avoid issues like that by not reminding the user, even if it looks like they are going to completely leave the page they should be on. I also realized when narrating the script out loud I had included several typos from copying and I should make sure to go through every detail to avoid these minor errors in future user testing. 


Overall, I learned about how a new user would view and interact with this website and was informed more about the website's poor design that I overlooked as I had more time and experience with it. I would say the user testing could have gone better because I could have gained more insight into what a user would change about the Less is More website. I realized that the user did not frequently speak their thoughts aloud during the tasks and I could have done a better job of reminding the user to do that, but I was so caught up in reminding myself not to assist the user that I forgot about that. As a moderator, I would need to remember to be on my toes during the test to not forget any important elements of the study. I need to be more careful with script preparation and utilize more checks for user testing in the future, due to all the typos that were in the form that made it difficult to follow.bsite should improve.
