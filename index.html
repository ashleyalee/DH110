    <h2 class="lead">UX Project by Ashley Lee</h2>

    <p>As part of the Fall 2022 Digital Humanities 110 course, our design challenge was to tackle one of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals. I chose to focus on Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. When thinking about this goal, I wanted to think of how the human population could reduce their consumption and production in easy and feasible ways throughout our daily lives. I was interested in creating a product that would allow users to purchase and sell second-hand items with more ease, thus directly reducing consumption and indirectly reducing production of goods. I hope that this will hopefully allow result in a more sustainable lifestyle for the users.

    <br>
    <br>
    Throughout the course of the quarter, I went through the different stages of product design. This started off with product and user research, and then designing and testing my own prototype on Figma. Throughout the process, I had to continually test the product to ensure the user's needs are at the forefront of the design.</p>

    <br>

        Design Statement

    <div class="card-body">
      <blockquote class="lead blockquote mb-0">
        <p>It is not an overstatement when we say that the human population has overconsumed and overproduced the resources available to us. As a result, our planet has more waste and an imbalanced distribution and supply of resources. As individuals, we are all responsible for this problem, which can be seen through our consumption habits. However, we can combat this by being more cautious of how we use and create our resources.
          <br>
          <br>
In light of this issue, I wanted to create a product that would allow consumers to be more mindful of their carbon footprint when shopping. I envisioned an e-commerce platform for second-hand items that shows users the impact of their carbon footprint for each product they sell and purchase. Hopefully, this will not only show users the impact each product has on the environment but also encourage them to purchase second-hand. Ultimately, this would contribute to the UN Goal of encouraging Responsible Consumption and Production.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Initially, I conducted heuristic analysis on two websites to get a better idea of how other websites concerned with ecological footprints presented their information and allowed users to take action.: <a href="https://www.footprintcalculator.org/home/en">Footprint Calculator by Global Footprint Network</a> and <a href="https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/">WWF Footprint Calculator</a>.</p>

        <p class="card-text">While these sites were not entirely similar to my idea, they allowed me to learn more about websites that were concerned with encouraging users to live more sustainably. To conduct the heuristic evaluation, I referenced Jakob Nielsonâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics. 

From conducting this research, I learned how to critically examine a website and its characteristics beyond the information I normally see and use on a page. On the Global Footprint Network Footprint Calculator page, I realized that while the aesthetics were pleasing, it drew users away from being able to complete the questionnaire, revealing the imbalance in heuristics that this suffered from. On the WWF Footprint Calculator page, I learned how the heuristics were emphasized through its simple structure, but also lacked flexiibility and ease of recognition.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Following the heuristic analysis process, I conducted usability to ensure that the issues I identified were indeed issues that users would likewise be concerned with.</p>

            <hr>
        <p class="card-text">I decided to conduct Usability Testing on another product, <a href="https://lessismore.org/">Less is More</a>, the ultimate waste reduction resource for citizens of Santa Barbara county. I decided to try a different website than what I focused on for my Heuristic Analysis because I wanted to focus on one that provided solutions to reducing consumption, which would more closely align to the UN Sustainable Development Goal that I was working on. At this time, I did not think of creating an ecommerce platform as my final product, so I was working with something more informative, rather than interactive (which my final product is intended to be). For the usability testing activity, I asked my user to complete similar tasks that I was hoping to implement in my product at that time. 

The results helped me to understand how my user interacted with websites similar in nature to the one I was working with. This gave me insight on how to design my own product and what features to emphasize or stay away from.</p>

          <p class="card-text">From conducting this usability test, I gained insight into how UX research and testing is done in the product life cycle.</p>

        <p class="card-text">After conducting competitor analysis, I decided to focus on my target user so that I could appropriately design a product that is usable and human centered. To do this, I thought about the ideal person that would be using my product and really try to put myself in their shoes. I interviewed a mutual friend who I thought would be a good fit in my user population and learned more about their perspectives while using the Facebook marketplace platform. I used this product because this is when I decided that I would wanted to create a product that would allow users to learn about their carbon footprint while shopping.</p>

    <h2 class="display-6 py-5">Conclusions</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>Overall, I enjoyed going through the user research and design process a lot!</p>

    <p>I didn't expect to have so much fun doing the contextual inquiry, so that step was definitely one of my favorites.
    Looking back at my goals to declutter Ultimate-Guitar and to make it more accessible to beginner guitar players while still providing advanced users flexibility,
    I think I was able to fulfill most of those goals, as evidenced from my prototype UT tests! The prototype is far from perfect though (as is the case with all designs), and I think another round of research into annotation and transposition could be helpful. That way, we could find if guitar players don't annotate guitar tabs the
    same way as classical musicians with their sheet music. Thus, this project can be part of a larger project with many more design iterations.</p>

    <p>The hardest part of the design process was the interface design and recruiting members from my target audience for UT. It was difficult selecting colors that would maintain enough color contrast while
    minimizing the number of hues in the design, and I also had the issue of choosing whether to maintain Ultimate-Guitar's black-yellow color scheme despite my impression test indicating that the scheme appeared outdated. UT recruitment was difficult as well,
    hence why two of my prototype's UT participants were college-students rather than middle-aged. Nevertheless, Professor Sookie provided me with one potential connection, which helped me recruit another participant through snowballing. Conducting these UTs also illustrated how demographics play a large role in
    how someone interacts with a website, which was something I hadn't considered before.</p>

    <p>In the future, aside from conducting more research, I'd want to refine my color scheme and do more impression tests on different hues, recruiting members from both the Ultimate-Guitar community and outside of it. That way, I can determine
    whether changing the brand's colors would affect user satisfaction, especially since some of these users have likely been accessing this website for years.</p>
