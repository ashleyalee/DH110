    <h2 class="lead">UX Project by Ashley Lee</h2>

    <p>As part of the Fall 2022 Digital Humanities 110 course, our design challenge was to tackle one of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals. I chose to focus on Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. When thinking about this goal, I wanted to think of how the human population could reduce their consumption and production in easy and feasible ways throughout our daily lives. I was interested in creating a product that would allow users to purchase and sell second-hand items with more ease, thus directly reducing consumption and indirectly reducing production of goods. I hope that this will hopefully allow result in a more sustainable lifestyle for the users.

    <br>
    <br>
    Throughout the course of the quarter, I went through the different stages of product design. This started off with product and user research, and then designing and testing my own prototype on Figma. Throughout the process, I had to continually test the product to ensure the user's needs are at the forefront of the design.</p>

    <br>

        Design Statement

    <div class="card-body">
      <blockquote class="lead blockquote mb-0">
        <p>It is not an overstatement when we say that the human population has overconsumed and overproduced the resources available to us. As a result, our planet has more waste and an imbalanced distribution and supply of resources. As individuals, we are all responsible for this problem, which can be seen through our consumption habits. However, we can combat this by being more cautious of how we use and create our resources.
          <br>
          <br>
In light of this issue, I wanted to create a product that would allow consumers to be more mindful of their carbon footprint when shopping. I envisioned an e-commerce platform for second-hand items that shows users the impact of their carbon footprint for each product they sell and purchase. Hopefully, this will not only show users the impact each product has on the environment but also encourage them to purchase second-hand. Ultimately, this would contribute to the UN Goal of encouraging Responsible Consumption and Production.</p>

            <hr>
        <p class="card-text">Initially, I conducted heuristic analysis on two websites to get a better idea of how other websites concerned with ecological footprints presented their information and allowed users to take action.: <a href="https://www.footprintcalculator.org/home/en">Footprint Calculator by Global Footprint Network</a> and <a href="https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/">WWF Footprint Calculator</a>.</p>

        <p class="card-text">While these sites were not entirely similar to my idea, they allowed me to learn more about websites that were concerned with encouraging users to live more sustainably. To conduct the heuristic evaluation, I referenced Jakob Nielsonâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics. 

From conducting this research, I learned how to critically examine a website and its characteristics beyond the information I normally see and use on a page. On the Global Footprint Network Footprint Calculator page, I realized that while the aesthetics were pleasing, it drew users away from being able to complete the questionnaire, revealing the imbalance in heuristics that this suffered from. On the WWF Footprint Calculator page, I learned how the heuristics were emphasized through its simple structure, but also lacked flexiibility and ease of recognition.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Following the heuristic analysis process, I conducted usability testing to ensure that the issues I identified were indeed issues that users would likewise be concerned with.</p>

            <hr>
        <p class="card-text">I decided to conduct Usability Testing on another product, <a href="https://lessismore.org/">Less is More</a>, the ultimate waste reduction resource for citizens of Santa Barbara county. I decided to try a different website than what I focused on for my Heuristic Analysis because I wanted to focus on one that provided solutions to reducing consumption, which would more closely align to the UN Sustainable Development Goal that I was working on. At this time, I did not think of creating an ecommerce platform as my final product, so I was working with something more informative, rather than interactive (which my final product is intended to be). For the usability testing activity, I asked my user to complete similar tasks that I was hoping to implement in my product at that time. 

The results helped me to understand how my user interacted with websites similar in nature to the one I was working with. This gave me insight on how to design my own product and what features to emphasize or stay away from.</p>

          <p class="card-text">From conducting this usability test, I gained insight into how UX research and testing is done in the product life cycle.</p>

To do this, I thought about the ideal person that would be using my product and really try to put myself in their shoes. I interviewed a mutual friend who I thought would be a good fit in my user population and learned more about their perspectives while using the Facebook marketplace platform. I used this product because this is when I decided that I would wanted to create a product that would allow users to learn about their carbon footprint while shopping.</p>

        <p class="card-text">While conducting user research, I learned that there was so much I did not know about my target user. I learned about the decision process and contexts where my user participates in selling/buying second-hand items.

    <h2 class="display-6 py-5">Conclusion and Reflection</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>Overall, this project provided me with so much insight about UI/UX. At each stage, I was able to learn about a different aspect of user research and product design. From the competitor analysis stage, I was able to constructively critique platforms that were similar to mine and develop improvements that I could apply to my own product. From the user research stages, I was able to put my feet in the shoes of my ideal user base and reduce and biases that I had about my users. From developing the product, I learned that the process is continual and can always be improved through research and developing new iterations. These steps were all integral in culminating into the final product I envisioned. 
</p>

    <p>This project came with several challenges as well. It was difficult finding users who seemed very passionate about buying and selling used items online from my circle of contacts. I needed to branch out to find someone who would truly meet the demographic I was looking for. Additionally, it was also difficult to design this product from scratch while trying to keep the heuristics in mind. There were several ideas I wanted to try but I felt that they would not align with the heuristics or other design principles we learned in class. 
</p>

    <p>While my product is similar to existing ecommerce websites, I hope that this product will allow consumers to be environmentally conscious as they are shopping and also cleaning through old items. I hope that from learning about the impact that purchasing or selling a used item will have on their carbon footprint, users will be more conscious about what they are purchasing and ultimately be more inclined to use this page and live more sustainably. To improve the product and differentiate it from other ecommerce pages, I would consider adding informative resources that can teach people where their product came from and how their carbon footprint is calculated. This would hopefully provide users with more reason to use this website over other ecommerce websites.
