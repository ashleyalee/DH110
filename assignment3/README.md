## Contextual Inquiry

### Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
>My project will allow users to purchase and sell used items with more ease, thus directly reducing consumption and indirectly reducing production of goods. This will hopefully allow users to live out a more sustainable lifestyle. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
>This activity fulfills the user's physiological needs (clothing, shelter, etc.), which is at the bottom of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>A current traditional solution to satisfy this need is to shop at brick and mortar second hand stores to reduce consumption and production. However, because the amount of first-hand shops exceeds the amount of second-hand shops available, and the selection provided at each store is not as broad, this results in second-hand shopping experiences that are not as enjoyable or accessible. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>When shopping for second-hand items in brick-and-mortar stores, it is typical that users aren't always able to or have the patience to find what they are looking for. However, by transitioning to online second-hand stores, they will be able to more easily find what they are looking for with the help of features such as the search bar and filter options. In the same way, users may have a higher chance of selling their items since more people may be satisfied with the search process and the ease in finding the product they are looking for. 

### Step 2: Target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**
>These users typically are of the Millenial or Gen-Z generations, who have a source of income to spend. They are aware of second-hand shopping and have done so in person before. Specifically, these users may find second-hand shopping to be tiresome and frustrating because 

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
>Users would shop for second-hand items when they are looking for items that they do not necessarily need to be purchased first-hand. Some reasons for this could be that they want to shop more sustainably and reduce consumption or want a cheaper alternative. If a user only needs the product for a one-time use or is searching for vintage/unique items, they might also consider purchasing second-hand. 

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
>To shop second-hand, users may shop at brick-and-mortar thrift/second-hand stores. People may also shop through mobile apps, such as DePop or Poshmark, or through social media pages. Others may also shop online at platforms like Ebay or Facebook Marketplace.
