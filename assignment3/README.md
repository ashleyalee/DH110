# DH 110 Assignment 4 - Ashley Lee

## Contextual Inquiry

### Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
>My project will allow users to purchase and sell used items with more ease, thus directly reducing consumption and indirectly reducing production of goods. This will hopefully allow users to live out a more sustainable lifestyle. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
>This activity fulfills the user's physiological needs (clothing, shelter, etc.), which is at the bottom of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>A current traditional solution to satisfy this need is to shop at brick and mortar second hand stores to reduce consumption and production. However, because the amount of first-hand shops exceeds the amount of second-hand shops available, and the selection provided at each store is not as broad, this results in second-hand shopping experiences that are not as enjoyable or accessible. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>When shopping for second-hand items in brick-and-mortar stores, it is typical that users aren't always able to or have the patience to find what they are looking for. However, by transitioning to online second-hand stores, they will be able to more easily find what they are looking for with the help of features such as the search bar and filter options. In the same way, users may have a higher chance of selling their items since more people may be satisfied with the search process and the ease in finding the product they are looking for. 

### Step 2: Target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**
>These users typically are of the Millenial or Gen-Z generations, who have a source of income to spend. They are aware of second-hand shopping and have done so in person before. Specifically, these users may find second-hand shopping to be tiresome and frustrating because of the amount of energy and time required to find a desired item. These users may be interested in reducing their carbon footprint or are interested in cheaper alternatives. 

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
>Users would shop for second-hand items when they are looking for items that they do not necessarily need to be purchased first-hand. Some reasons for this could be that they want to shop more sustainably and reduce consumption or want a cheaper alternative. If a user only needs the product for a one-time use or is searching for vintage/unique items, they might also consider purchasing second-hand. 

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
>To shop second-hand, users may shop at brick-and-mortar thrift/second-hand stores. People may also shop through mobile apps, such as DePop or Poshmark, or through social media pages. Others may also shop online at platforms like Ebay or Facebook Marketplace.  

### Step 3: Pick a Qualitative Research Method
I conducted **participatory observation research** with a mutual friend who fits my target user persona. I held an interview where I learned more about my target user through discussion questions and interactive activities. Please refer to the materials used in the next section for more details.

### Step 4: Plan the details
I decided to conduct this participatory observation research in person at UCLA with a mutual friend who fit my target user persona. I recorded the session using the Zoom recording feature and transcribed the recording after the session. 



### Step 5: Conduct the Research

### Step 6: Documentation & Reflection

## Participatory Research Materials

**1. Contextual Inquiry Guide**

Please find my **script** for this interview [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1deNEtd-r155F-ZNYfkmh4xWlLYpluqrDOF_TwX7BgQ8/edit), with an introduction, goals, and contextual questions.

**2. User Data**

Please find the **recording** of the interview [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XywoY38WOYZZt3z06I9ryTEVZK_Zgyo9/view?usp=sharing).

The **transcription** of the interview can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kqBzDjJ_XDwD77_coaovXrem6W9d520NsBAA6oOGvn0/edit?usp=sharing).

### Here are some interesting quotes and insights from the interview:

**:one: How the user chooses to plan their parking ahead of time (3:04)**
> If I know where I'm going, I like to plan ahead so I will try. If I'm going to a difficult place, an area that I know is going to be very difficult to find parking, like Downtown LA, I will do research in advance like I will look for parking structures and save the address of the parking structure in my phone. But if it's like the grocery store, I know where the parking is. I'll find a spot eventually.

**:two: The user's preferences on paid parking (5:03)**
> I prefer to abstain from going to places that charge exorbitant amounts of money or don't give you the option of at least like an hour free parking. So I'm like, "That's lame." You're capitalizing on people's needs.

**:three: What the user dislikes about the way they look for parking currently (6:13)**
> You never know what you're going to get. Like, you don't know if it's going to be available, if there are places (parking spots) that are gonna be open.

**:four: The user's ranking of the importance of parking (on a scale of 1-10) as a component of an entire trip (17:40)**
>Okay, so, back to one of your other questions about what if it's important, or how important it is or like, how much will I suffer. Even if the parking is difficult, like, if I'm going somewhere for the first time, fine, I'll suffer through but then the next time it is now a factor I know that it's going to be difficult. So that is becomes a bigger portion of my number — I may turn into like a six or seven. So I think it depends on destination or whether and I've been there, but also I could be willing to give it another shot.



## Reflection

I enjoyed the contextual inquiry process because of the freedom it gave me to make observations and learn from other users with neither me nor them being inhibited by any kind of preconceptions, like the user/participant may have been in the more formal Usability Test. I found the additional questions, not only about the product, but about the user’s background and personal conceptions of the space/community I am exploring to be particularly interesting. Several of the points made by the participant aligned with ideas I had already had regarding new features for the product, so it was great to see this unbiased validation, since this participant was not at all informed about my ideas. I appreciated the participant’s openness and addition of many details into their descriptions and statements — this interview allowed me to acquire a pretty clear idea of one kind of user persona. However, I am not sure if I did every component of this user interview correctly as I did pose some guiding questions/statements to the participant without following as strict of guidelines as outlined in the example script. I think what would be helpful to me would be to be a participant in a study myself and see how other more experienced researchers conduct such interviews.
