# DH 110 Assignment 4 - Ashley Lee

## Contextual Inquiry

### Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
>My project will allow users to purchase and sell used items with more ease, thus directly reducing consumption and indirectly reducing production of goods. This will hopefully allow users to live out a more sustainable lifestyle. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
>This activity fulfills the user's physiological needs (clothing, shelter, etc.), which is at the bottom of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>A current traditional solution to satisfy this need is to shop at brick and mortar second hand stores to reduce consumption and production. However, because the amount of first-hand shops exceeds the amount of second-hand shops available, and the selection provided at each store is not as broad, this results in second-hand shopping experiences that are not as enjoyable or accessible. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>When shopping for second-hand items in brick-and-mortar stores, it is typical that users aren't always able to or have the patience to find what they are looking for. However, by transitioning to online second-hand stores, they will be able to more easily find what they are looking for with the help of features such as the search bar and filter options. In the same way, users may have a higher chance of selling their items since more people may be satisfied with the search process and the ease in finding the product they are looking for. 

### Step 2: Target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**
>These users typically are of the Millenial or Gen-Z generations, who have a source of income to spend. They are aware of second-hand shopping and have done so in person before. Specifically, these users may find second-hand shopping to be tiresome and frustrating because of the amount of energy and time required to find a desired item. These users may be interested in reducing their carbon footprint or are interested in cheaper alternatives. 

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
>Users would shop for second-hand items when they are looking for items that they do not necessarily need to be purchased first-hand. Some reasons for this could be that they want to shop more sustainably and reduce consumption or want a cheaper alternative. If a user only needs the product for a one-time use or is searching for vintage/unique items, they might also consider purchasing second-hand. 

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
>To shop second-hand, users may shop at brick-and-mortar thrift/second-hand stores. People may also shop through mobile apps, such as DePop or Poshmark, or through social media pages. Others may also shop online at platforms like Ebay or Facebook Marketplace.  

### Step 3: Pick a Qualitative Research Method
I conducted **participatory observation research** with a mutual friend who fits my target user persona. I held an interview where I learned more about my target user through discussion questions and interactive activities. Please refer to the materials used in the next section for more details.

### Step 4: Plan the details
I decided to conduct this participatory observation research in person in a study room at UCLA with a mutual friend who fit my target user persona. I recorded the session using the Zoom recording feature and transcribed the recording after the session. 

During the session, I observed two activities: 
* I asked the user to shop for a pair of rain boots on Facebook Marketplace, which is an online second-hand e-commerce platform.
* I asked the user to list a pair of rain boots on Marketplace for sale.

### Step 6: Documentation & Reflection

### Here are some interesting quotes and insights from the interview:

**:one: The user's painpoints with second-hand shopping (5:45)**
> *I'm frustrated at Goodwill because it's hard to find stuff, but you go in with the mindset knowing that it's going to be a hunt. Facebook Marketplace, sometimes it's frustrating just because there isn't always something that I need on there and a lot of the good stuff is like taken or people don't get back to me ASAP when I message them to see if item is available.*

**:two: The user's decision making process when purchasing second-hand items (6:45)**
> *I look at the pictures and make sure there's no imperfections or anything. Sometimes, I go in person to see the item because I want to make sure it works. Maybe like reviews online of the sellers, if the sellers trustworthy too, like general vibe check, like the smell of clothes if there's stains on it. Yeah, but it's more so like if it works and if it looks good, it doesn't look broken.*

**:three: The user's decisino making process when purchasing on Facebook Marketplace (18:05)**
> *I would have to message them. I have to go see it in person or, through Facetime.*

**:four: Feature that would ease the user's experience when listing an item (21:04)**
> *Maybe if they could find the link for me of where I got it based off of the image or based off of what I put in. So if I put in boots from MadeWell, they could give me suggested links of products and I could click that link and then put it in there.*

## Reflection

I enjoyed the contextual inquiry process because it gave me the freedom to make observations and learn from my target user without being as intrusive and hands-on as in the initial Usability Testing assignment. The opportunity to ask questions in this interview allowed me to learn a lot more about my target user and their habits in relation to the solution I am trying to implement. My interviewee was very verbal, which allowed me to better understand her ideas and thought process when using the product. As I went through all the discussion questions and activities, I was able to gain a new perspective into the user experience and erase any assumptions I may have had about my targt user or expectations that I had coming into this interview.
