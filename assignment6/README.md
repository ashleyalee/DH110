# Interface Design
## Assignment 6
Ashley Lee | DH110

## Project Description

This assignment aims to explore potential designs of my marketplace platform. The platform allows users to sell and buy second hand products while learning about the impact their actions (selling/buying a specific product) have on their ecological footprint. For example, with each product page that users are looking to purchase, there is a feature that will tell them how much of their ecological footprint they are reducing. The screen that I chose to design is the homepage, which asks the user what they are trying to do: sell or buy a product. 

## Purpose of UX Interface Design

The purpose of UX Interface Design is to convert low-fidelity wireframes into digitized designs that can later be transformed into interactive prototypes and eventually a final application. This provides the designer with another opportunity to get feedback and test out their design from a target user.

## Design Process

I based this interface design off of my low fidelity prototype as a reference. However, there are some changes in the design since I wanted to test out a slightly different idea to involve the ecological footprint factor. I started off with an iPhone 8/SE frame. I drafted out the layout from my low-fidelity prototype and included more details. This frame captures the main features of the application, allowing users to select if they are trying to purchase or sell an item and explore other items catered to their interest in an 'explore' page. During my process, I tested different typography, shape, and color variations for the app's main "Sell/Buy" page. After completion of the design, I ran two impression tests to further assist my process. I also ran an accessibility test to check for proper color contrast.

## Graphical Interface Design Variation

## Design and GUI Component Layout

### Decision Process and Design Details
I decided to design the main "Sell/Buy" page. I chose this frame because it captures the main page of functions that the user can do on the app, which are to either buy or sell products. The overall layout of this page includes a search bar for what item they are looking to buy/sell, and then two buttons that allow them to choose whether they are trying to buy or sell that product to complete their search query. Below this section are some products that are generated to their liking for them to explore. The overall layout of this page includes a menu button, chat button, title of the application, sell/buy buttons, search bar, and product images. For the grid layout, I utilized 5 rows with 20px gutter and 20px margin, and 2 columns with 20px gutter and 20px margin. The rows were used to align the different sections of the page, including the search bar component and the 'explore' section.

## Typography Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
For typography, I wanted a look that is fun yet professional. First, I tried using the Quicksand font because it has a young, fun appearance with the rounded corners and different boldness options. Second, I tested the Spectral font, which had a much more professional look. After these two tests, I felt that Quicksand appeared slightly too disorganized/unprofessional, and Spectral appeared too formal. I researched more fonts through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), and found that Roboto Slab was a happy medium of these two fonts. Using Roboto Slab for every text item on the application was a bit much, so I mixed in Roboto for subtitles, and used Playfair Display for the main app title. My final topography is shown at the very right in the image above. Details for these fonts are below.

| Text | Typeface | Font Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main Title (H1) | Playfair Display | 54px | Bold |
| Lesson Title (H2) | Roboto Slab | 34px | Regular |
| Lesson Subtitle (H3) | Roboto | 20px | Light Italic |
| Button Label (H4) | Roboto Slab | 24px | Regular |
| Status Percent (H6) | Roboto | 11px | Light |

## Button Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
I tested three button variations: rectangle with slightly rounded corners, rectangle with one circular corner, and rectangle with fully rounded corners. While I thought that the one circular corner option was unique, I felt that it had too much movement in the design. I decided to go with the slightly rounded corner option, because the buttons appeared more stable and stationary. This stationary look is what I feel goes best with learning-topic-buttons. Details for this design are below:

| Width | Height | Padding | Radius |
|---|---|---|---|
| 322px | 104px | 8px (left, right) | 12px |

## Chat Icon Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
I accessed these chat icons from [Icons8.com](https://icons8.com/). However, if I had more time on this part of my project, I would have designed each icon by hand. These were the top four chat icons I liked from the site. I tested two round chat shapes, one rectangular chat shape, and one multi-chat icon. When testing these icons, I felt that the circle shape was too tall and looked unprofessional. I appreciated the rectangular icon, but it appeared slightly too square for the overall look. Thus, I decided to use the ovular chat shape because it has less height, but still has roundness. This is seen in the second frame in the image above. The icon image measures 36px by 27px.

## Additional Detailing

### Decision Process and Design Details
As I continued to look at my design, I felt it needed a more clear grouping of elements. Based on [Gestalt Theory](https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#composition), both implicit containment and explicit containment can help improve a design's visual grouping. I decided to create a unique shape to add movement and create explicit containment around the top section of the screen. Details for the shape design are documented under [Design Summary](#design-summary). I then utilized my original grid layout to ensure that the elements were still spaced properly. Lastly, I added a drop-shadow to the buttons and rounded the corners of the status bars (2px). The final design is shown in the rightmost frame in the image above.

## Color Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
I tested several different color variations. Six are shown above. To help me decide color schemes, I used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) for color combinations and [Visme](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/) for further inspiration. I tested Analagous, Complementary, Monochromatic, and Primary color combinations. Different shades and hues were used to color the individual components of the design. I researched more about color psychology, specifically for [color in branding](https://www.ignytebrands.com/the-psychology-of-color-in-branding/#3), and found that blue and purple hues are what I would like to use for my music learning app. Blue instills a sense of dependability, logic, serenity, and security. Whereas purple instills a sense of wisdom, imagination, and sophistication. I decided to test more variations of the monochromatic indigo design in the bottom left frame shown above.

## Monochromatic Indigo Variations

### Decision Process and Design Details
To further test the color variations, I used a [Preference Test](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/preference-testing) to see which design was most appealing to users. The feedback I got from this test is as follows:

| Screen 1 | Screen 2 | Screen 3 |
|---|---|---|
| "The title looks a little too dark" | "It's too purple for me" | "The icons at the bottom are hard to see" |
| "I can't see the button labels very well" | "The menu icon is hard to see" | "I like this bluer color more" |
| "I don't like how the buttons are darker than the background" | "I like the buttons' contrast with the background" | "The buttons really stand out here" |

Overall, participants preferred Screen 3, with the minor issue that the bottom buttons were difficult to see. The title text has great contrast with the background design, making it stand out. The button labels stand out clearly against the light button color. And the menu and chat icons are a brighter color so they do not get lost in the dark background. I made some small changes to lighten the bottom bar, and my final color design is shown below (in light and dark mode).

## Impression Test
According to Yale University's [usability site](https://usability.yale.edu/usability-testing/impression-testing), two popular ways for impression testing are picking adjectives, and the five-second test. I decided to conduct both these tests with separate samples of participants. I made the Picking-Adjectives test through Google Forms, and sent the test to 50 undergraduate students at UCLA (sent via groupme). I made the Five-Second Test through Usability Hub, and sent this test to 20 friends and family living in Orange County (sent via iMessage). I felt that my close friends/family should take the Five-Second Test rather than the Adjectives test to reduce bias. The students participating in the Adjectives test were past classmates who I have never met in person. 13 responses were submitted for the Five-Second Test, and 36 responses were submitted for the Picking-Adjectives Test. Results are below:

### Observations
Based on results for the "What is this app used for" question, the top impressions users noted were music, learning, tuning, and reading. It was interesting to see that many users believed the app's purpose was for tuning instruments. I think that this was a common answer because the app name is "TuneMate". Perhaps I should consider exploring other name options for the application, because the word "Tune" might be misleading for the app's purpose. However, "music" and "learning" were the most popular answers, which tells me that the main purpose of the app was conveyed to most users. Based on results for the word/sentence recall question, most users recalled rhythm, reading, fundamentals, and basic. These results demonstrated that the overall lesson names really stood out to users.

### Observations
Based on these results, it appeared that most users felt the app looked calm, simple, fresh, and useful. Many users also felt that the app apeared familiar and professional. It was encouraging to see these results, because I hoped to make the design as simple as possible but still appear useful and professional. A few users also said the app appeared to look cheap. I reached out to some design friends and they noted that the bottom-bar icons devalue the overall look. As I continue my design process, I will investigate other icon options and spend more time choosing icons that look sophisticated and fit the design well.

## Accessibility Test
To run a color-contrast check of my final design, I utilized the Spark plugin in Figma. The test results are shown below:
