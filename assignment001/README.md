## Reducing your Ecological Footprint
### Ashley Lee, DH110

For my project, I want to provide ways that people can calculcate and learn more about their ecological footprint and provide ways for them to improve their consumption, ultimately reducing their ecological footprint. I want to provide a way for users to be able to better understand what their footprint means so they can find that reducing their consumption does not need to be that difficult.

### Website 1: [Footprint Calculator by Global Footprint Network](footprintcalculator.org)

About: This website provides a series of questions to evaluate your ecological footprint, which is returned at the end of the survey. It then provides suggestions for how you can reduce your footprint based off your responses.

Overall evaluation: I would rate this website to be a 8/10 because it provides rather a user-friendly experience. The page is visually appealing and easy to use, which allows the user to truly engage with the product and make it through the end of the survey. However, I believe there are some areas that can be improved, which will be discussed below.

#### Heuristic Evaluation

**1. Visibility of System Status**  
While there is a progress bar at the top of the page and a loading screen when proceeding through the website, I did not initially notice the progress bar. The bar is very thin and in a subtle orange color that is not easily noticeable.

**2. Match Between Systems and the Real World**  
The survey questions use language that is easily understandable, such as 'far' and 'not far' in the scales. This makes it easy for the users to respond to the questions and hopefully solicit more accurate responses.

**3. User Control and Freedom**  
Users are able to easily change their responses while remaining on the same question and even after they have progressed to another question. They are not constrained to the page they are currently on.

**4. Consistency and Standards**  
The response options on the page are pretty standard and similar to how other typical tests function. The arrows on the page are also standard and noticeable that they are used to progress to the next page.

**5. Error Prevention**  
The website does not provide much space for error, however, it does allow you to proceed to the next page without changing your response to the previous page. Because of this, users may possibly skip questions if double clicking on the arrows too quickly.

**6. Recognition Rather than Recall**  
The page provides users with conversions for measurements (ie. km to mi) so users do not have to convert it on their own. There are also images on each page that correspond to the questions so users can have a reference when answering them.

**7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**  
Each page/question on this website has a link 'Add Details to Improve Accuracy' that allows users to answer more questions to be considered in their ecological footprint calculation. Users are not required to answer these questions, so they are not left on the page and possibly overwhelm the users.

**8. Aesthetic and Minimal Design**  
The page is aesthetic with the different illustrations on each page, however, it can feel busy since the illustrations change with your responses. This page is not very minimalistic since the images span the entire page and additional text (donate button) can distract the user from completing the questions. There are also animations on the page that distract the user.

**9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors**  
Because this survey is very subjective and simple to follow, there is not much room for error. The only thing is that users are able to proceed to the next page without modifying their response for the previous/current page.

**10. Help and Documentation**  
Each question provides an explanation and context so users can know what they are specifically being asked.
